## Multiple myeloma, a disease of monoclonal plasma cells
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy that initiates from a bone marrow resident clonal plasma cell that acquires successive mutational changes and genomic alterations to become highly proliferative polyclonal malignant plasma cells.

## Detecting circulating tumor plasma cells
Since circulating plasma cells have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis, there is a need for robust detection and morpho-genomic characterization of aberrant plasma cells in the blood.

## Genomic profiling of malignant plasma cells
The pathogenesis of myeloma is initiated when germinal center (GC) B-cells undergoing normal affinity maturation encounter an error either in somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus, or class-switch recombination (G. J. Morgan, Walker, and Davies 2012). These distinct initial genetic errors give rise respectively, to a set of characteristic chromosomal translocations such as t(11,14), t(4,14), 14q32, t(14,16), involving the IGH locus or, alternatively a process leading to characteristic hyperdiploidy of certain chromosomes. Together these large chromosomal structural events define two genomic categories that comprise the hallmarks of myeloma genetics (Anderson and Carrasco 2011; G. J. Morgan, Walker, and Davies 2012). Coupled with Flow Cytometry (FC)-based analysis these hallmark myeloma cytogenetic events are core to myeloma clinical diagnosis, staging, and disease monitoring (S. K. Kumar and Rajkumar 2018; Abdallah et al. 2020; Cardona-Benavides, de Ramón, and Gutiérrez 2021). CD138+ cells isolated from bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) undergo clinical standard karyotyping and Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) assays to identity the presence of canonical trisomies in odd numbered chromosomes (hyperdiploid disease), and for translocations (non-hyperdiploid disease) which together allow for patient stratification and therapy selection, particularly for high risk SMM (Abdallah et al. 2020; Lakshman et al. 2018).
