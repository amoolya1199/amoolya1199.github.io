This project provides an application of data analysis and modeling to a real-world challenge. The dataset contains a diverse set of features that can be explored and analyzed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the popularity of a photograph. I used a variety of machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the lifetime download count of a photograph. The project focuses not only on achieving high accuracy in their models but also to consider factors such as interpretability and generalizability. A model that achieves high accuracy on the training set but performs poorly on unseen data is not considered a good model. The models developed were ensured that it can generalize well on unseen data while still being interpretable and easy to understand.
