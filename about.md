---**Prelude**

I'm currently a Computational Biology - Data Science Co-op at [NextRNA Therapeutics](http://nextrna.com/), working on RNA-directed medicines.
Prior to my current role, I earned a MAsters degree in Bioinformatics from [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/master-of-science-in-bioinformatics/). I previously worked as a research assistant at the [Dong lab](https://sijiadong.com/), where I designed python scripts for the automation of enzyme-cofactor reactions analysis from research papers. I also mentored and provided guidance to bioinformatics graduate students to help understand programming in Bioinformatics as the teaching assistant for a python programming course for two consecutive semesters. During the course of my Bachelor's in Biotechnology, I gained the domain knowledge of cancer biology, RNA biology, genomics, proteomics, drug designing and structural biology among many others. 

---**Niche** 

It’s an incontrovertible fact that research has served as the fulcrum for igniting ideas and thoughts in most people, if not all. This aspect of research is precisely what makes me consider bioinformatics such a fascinating, engrossing field of science. There are numerous ways of solving a research problem and bioinformatics paves the way, giving rise to endless possibilities and unconventional ways of looking at a research problem. 

The interdisciplinary facet of biotechnology—its predisposition to overlap with other scientific fields such as computer science, physics, and chemistry—is instrumental in engendering breakthroughs in order to solve real-world problems afflicting the current society. Computational biology possesses the power to make biological studies happen faster and more efficiently, considering the plethora of information that can be obtained from an individual's DNA. 

I am driven by the scientific curiosity to make a dent, if not a difference, in the field of medical drug designing. Motivated by a profound passion towards this unique field and humbled by the intricate complexity of disease biology, I am driven to utilize cutting-edge science and technology to create novel therapeutic agents that can eliminate afflictions and enhance human health.

As an ardent advocate of the remarkable capabilities of computational biology, machine learning and drug discovery, I am deeply devoted to advancing the field of biomedicine and therapeutics discovery by making it more accurate, consistent, and customizable.

---**Hobbies**

During my leisure hours, I enjoy indulging in various creative pursuits, such as crafting digital illustrations that allow me to express my artistic side. Additionally, I relish the intellectual stimulation and entertainment provided by reading books, while also finding solace in the outdoors and nature by embarking on invigorating hikes. I also have a strong thirst for knowledge and am always eager to acquire new skills and expand my understanding of the world around me.
