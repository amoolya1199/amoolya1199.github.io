## Hi, I'm Lib√®re
#### *Welcome to my page!*

I am a PhD Candidate in Medical Biophysics at Keck School of Medicine of USC and graduate research assistant at [USC Michelson Convergent Science Institute in Cancer](https://kuhn.usc.edu/) where I head up a research program in mapping and predicting the spatiotemporal progression of multiple myeloma (a blood cancer) using single cell biology, data science, and computational modeling.

Before USC, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology from Syracuse University and spent 2 years working in the biopharmaceutical industry developing machine learning models to predict (1) [off-targeting in gene silencing/editing](https://en.calameo.com/read/0041626681a7296f0e0a8) and (2) [drug-target interactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5166585/).

Outside the lab, I play football (aka soccer), learn about aircrafts and aviation, read philosophy, and explore the multifacated corners of Southern California.

Recently I joined the [Nucleate Los Angeles](https://www.nucleate.xyz/locations/los-angeles-ca/)'s leadership team.

Get in touch for anything biotechnology, machine/deep learning, single cell biology, therapeutic bioscience
