---**The basics**

I'm currently a Computational Biologist II at [NextRNA Therapeutics](nextrna.com) working on lncRNA-directed medicines.

Prior to my current role, I earned a Ph.D. in Medical Biophysics from the [Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California](https://keck.usc.edu/). In my doctoral research at [USC Michelson Convergent Science Institute in Cancer](https://kuhn.usc.edu/), I lead a research program developping multiparametric single cell assays and machine learning models for the spatiotemporal characterization of lymphoid cancers.
I also served as Strategy Lead @ [Nucleate Los Angeles](https://www.nucleate.xyz/locations/los-angeles-ca/) with the mission to empower the next-generation of biotech founders.

---**The larger mission**

Driven by scientific curiosity and humbled by the multiscale complexity of disease biology, I'm constantly inspired by the opportunity to leverage innovative science and technology to develop new medicines for the eradication of maladies and the betterment of human health.

As a champion of the extraordinary potential of biotechnology and AI/machine learning, I'm passionately committed to making biomedicine and therapeutics discovery more precise, predictable, and programmable.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology from Syracuse University and have led research projects in molecular and computational biology focusing on drug discovery, target identification, machine learning to predict off-targeting in gene editing and to deconvolute polypharmacology in drug target interactions.

Trained as a multidisciplinary scientist, I champion team science and find excitement in emerging biotechnologies and innovation in areas that hybridize computational and bench lab methods and strive to enable the next generation of innovators in biomedicine.

---**Hobbies**

In my free time, I like to play football (aka soccer), learn about aircrafts and aviation, read history and philosophy, and explore the vast outdoors--locally and internationally.
