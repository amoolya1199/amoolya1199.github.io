### Hello, Welcome to my site!

I am a PhD Candidate in Medical Biophysics at Keck School of Medicine of USC and graduate research assistant at [USC Michelson Convergent Science Institute in Cancer](https://kuhn.usc.edu/) where I head up a research program in mapping and predicting the spatiotemporal progression of multiple myeloma (a blood cancer) using single cell biology, and predictive math modeling.

Before USC, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology from Syracuse University and worked in the biopharmaceutical industry developing machine learning models to predict (1) [off-targeting in gene silencing/editing](https://en.calameo.com/read/0041626681a7296f0e0a8) and (2) [drug-target interactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5166585/).

Driven by scientific curiosity and humbled by the multiscale complexity of disease biology, I'm constantly inspired by the opportunity to leverage innovative science and technology to develop new medicines for the eradication of maladies and the betterment of human health.

As a champion of the extraordinary potential of biotechnology--genome engineering and synthetic biology--and computational science, I'm passionately committed to making biomedicine and therapeutic science more precise, predictable, and programmable.

I currently serve a Strategy Lead @ [Nucleate Los Angeles](https://www.nucleate.xyz/locations/los-angeles-ca/) where we are enabling and empowering the next-generation of biotech founders.

When i'm not doing science and research, I like to play football (aka soccer), learn about aircrafts and aviation, read philosophy, and explore vastness of the outdoors.

Get in touch for anything biotechnology, machine/deep learning, therapeutic science, quantum biology
