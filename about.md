### Hi, I'm Lib√®re.

<p align="left"><img width=15%" src="https://github.com/alansmathew/alansmathew/raw/master/lang.gif" alt="lang image here"/></p>

I am a PhD Candidate in Medical Biophysics at Keck School of Medicine of USC and graduate research assistant at [USC Michelson Convergent Science Institute in Cancer](https://kuhn.usc.edu/) where I head up a research program in mapping and predicting the spatiotemporal progression of multiple myeloma (a blood cancer) using single cell biology, and predictive math modeling.

Driven by scientific curiosity and humbled by the multiscale complexity of disease biology, I'm constantly inspired by the opportunity to leverage innovative science and technology to develop new medicines for the eradication of maladies and the betterment of human health.

As a champion of the extraordinary potential of biotechnology and AI/machine learning, I'm passionately committed to making biomedicine and therapeutics discovery more precise, predictable, and programmable.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology from Syracuse University and have been priviledged to work on various research projects in drug discovery, target identification, and development of machine learning models to predict off-targeting in gene editing and to deconvolute polypharmacology in drug target interactions.

My training as a multidisciplinary scientist afforded me a great appreciation for team science and I find excitment in emerging technology and innovation in areas that hybridize computational and bench lab methods and strive to enable the next generation of innovators in biomedicine.

Besides mentoring a team of five undergraduate reserarchers at USC, I currently serve as Strategy Lead @ [Nucleate Los Angeles](https://www.nucleate.xyz/locations/los-angeles-ca/) where we are empowering the next-generation of biotech founders.

When i'm not doing science and research, I like to play football (aka soccer), learn about aircrafts and aviation, read philosophy, and explore vastness of the outdoors.

I also love meeting anyone interested in biotechnology, machine/deep learning, therapeutics science, chaos theory, quantum biology, and game theory

Get in touch if these resonate with you!
