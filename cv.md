## Preface
It is possible that my fascination for science began from my first glance through the microscope at Paramecium back in the biology lab at school. Since then I have shown a predilection to learn about the world imperceptible by human eyes. As I got older I was intrigued by the interrelation of biology with computation, mathematics and technology, which led me to be inspired by the vast field of bioinformatics that perfectly amalgamates two of my most passionate fields - computer science and biology. My aim is fueled by a conviction to make a dent, if not a difference, in the field of medical drug designing, machine learning in bioinformatics, stem cell and cancer therapeutics.
