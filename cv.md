## Preamble
Health and time are respectively humankind’s most valuable asset and resource. Disease afflicts health and takes away time. My scientific curiosity is rooted in understanding the spatiotemporal pathogenesis of complex maladies. My life’s work is in (1) developing quantitative methods to deconvolute complex multimodal data and unravel disease biology in (2) developing innovative therapeutic modalities with the ultimate goal of preserving health and extending life.
